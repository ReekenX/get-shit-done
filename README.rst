GET SHIT DONE!
--------------

GET SHIT DONE is an easy to use command line program that blocks websites known to distract us from our work.

How it works?
-------------

Make a list of websites which distracts you from work and put to home directory named ``hosts.list``. Content can be, for example::

    facebook.com
    twitter.com
    etc.

One line per domain without ``www``.

Turn on and off
---------------

To turn on blocking run::

    sudo ./get-shit-done.py work

To turn off blocking run::

    sudo ./get-shit-done.py play
